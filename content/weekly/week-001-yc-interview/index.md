I've applied to [YC](https://ycombinator.com) 3 times before, and this is the first time I've been invited for interview. Below you can see the interview invite email (isn't it beautiful). Yes, this is only the first step in getting accepted, but it does feel like a new milestone! My interview is on 7th Nov 2019 - so lots to pack in before then!

## Daily Log

### Day 1
Thursday, 17 October 2019: üå¶ 14¬∞ - Light rain showers and a gentle breeze

Today I got the invite for YC, so I've been planning how to make a splash. Obviously feeling pretty motivated - so going to see if I can use that to be extra productive today.

  - [x] Created the plan
  - [x] Create a discussion forum for Snapboard
  - [x] Re-start the blog under Snap/Blog (the one you're reading right now!)
  - [x] Updates to the integration page for Snapboard
  - [ ] Updates to the homepage for Snapboard

Not a bad day - got most of the stuff I wanted to do done, and although the website still needs updating (it hasn't changed since first launch üòÖ), it's less of a priority so it's going to get parked for now.


### Day 2
Friday, 18 October 2019: üå¶ 14¬∞ - Light rain showers and a moderate breeze

  - [ ] Decide on my first 3 traction channels / what type of users to target
  - [ ] Add 10 new cards / integrations
  - [ ] Start Facebook approval (really complex review process üôÑ)
  - [ ] Public Snapboard metrics page
  - [ ] Updates to the homepage for Snapboard
  - [ ] Improve capturing of analytics events - so I can better understand user actions


#### Which users should I target?

I've seen all of these groups on the app so far, but I need to have more focus to make the product better for a specific group, and then I can scale to others later.

  1. Marketing guy/gal - probably uses Adwords, Social, Google Analytics - not as tech savvy, will rely almost exclusively on the pre-made cards being what they need.

  2. Start-up founders - this is an active group, and one likely to give me a lot of feedback and invest in the product. They probably have more apps as they're managing/covering a bigger area. Possibly less likely to pay? I'm also part of this group (and already know quite a few others in this group), which makes it attractive.

  3. Teams - this is probably to broad a group to be considered as an option right now, but definetely something we will want to cater specifically for in the future.

  4. Agencies - possibly less tech-savy. High conviction to pay if we get them something they want. They might be reasonably well served by existing dashboards though?

  5. E-commerce - often work through an agency for this type of reporting (although not exclusively),  so overlap with the above. Main focus would be on Shopify and other e-commerce platforms, but also has fairly strong links to marketing (as they're keen to understand attribution).


The key things to evaluate when picking the group to target is:

  1. How easily can I access this market - do I already know people in it?
  2. How likely are they to pay?
  3. How invested would they be in the product? Would they become embassadors?
  4. How technical the group is - would they be able to validate the customization angle.

Based on this, the main group I've decided to target is: **Start-up founders**. The biggest draw back here, is their likihood to pay. That said, if we can make it work for Start-up founders, then I think we will be able to transition into teams. Also, if we can make these guys pay - that's a very good sign!


#### What marketing channels should I use?

Based on the above - I've decided the 3 traction channels I'm going to try first:

  1. Integrate with Existing Platforms - this is a bit of a no brainer as Snapboard is built almost entirely built on integratons!

  2. Direct Mail - contact people directly who I think might be interested in having a board.

  3. Community - build this up around my blog, the community on Snapboard and others
