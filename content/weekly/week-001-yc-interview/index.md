I've applied to [YC](https://ycombinator.com) 3 times before, and this is the first time I've been invited for interview. Below you can see the interview invite email (isn't it beautiful). Yes, this is only the first step in getting accepted, but it does feel like a new milestone! My interview is on 7th Nov 2019 - so lots to pack in before then!

## Daily Log

### Day 1
Thursday, 17 October 2019: 🌦 14° - Light rain showers and a gentle breeze

Today I got the invite for YC, so I've been planning how to make a splash. Obviously feeling pretty motivated - so going to see if I can use that to be extra productive today.

  - [x] Created the plan
  - [x] Create a discussion forum for Snapboard
  - [x] Re-start the blog under Snap/Blog (the one you're reading right now!)
  - [x] Updates to the integration page for Snapboard
  - [ ] Updates to the homepage for Snapboard

Not a bad day - got most of the stuff I wanted to do done, and although the website still needs updating (it hasn't changed since first launch 😅), it's less of a priority so it's going to get parked for now.


### Day 2
Friday, 18 October 2019: 🌦 14° - Light rain showers and a moderate breeze

  - [ ] Add 10 new cards / integrations
  - [ ] Public Snapboard metrics page
  - [ ] Decide on my first 3 traction channels
  - [ ] Updates to the homepage for Snapboard
