Last week went well, but the major focus has to be on creating more cards, more quickly. In addition, these remain my top priorities:

 1. Cards - adding new integrations and cards
 2. Marketing - getting people to visit to [snapboard.io](https://snapboard.io)
 3. Optimize - small changes which increase conversion - getting more people to signup and create cards
 4. Talk - keep talking to users (which should help shape the above items)


## Plan

Based on the above - I want to acheive the following this week:

  - [ ] Talk to 3 more users
  - [ ] Improve "edit card" page
  - [ ] Create 40 new cards / integrations
  - [ ] Start testing 3 [“Traction”](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/0241242533) growth channels
  - [ ] Setup public Snapboard metrics page - so I can better track changes


## Daily Log

### Day 1

Thursday, 24 October 2019: 🌧 12° - Rain, Rain, Rain

Ok, so today I need to:

 - [x] Create backlog for Front-end for Julio to work on
 - [ ] Create new card inputs apprach (make editing cards much nicer!)

Ah man, didn't feel like a very productive day 😅 - I spent a bit of time thinking about how to make the cards easier to edit - and that kind of thing never feels productive, but is obviously a neccessary step before 

Starting to feel very nervous about the [YC interview](/week-001) date. It's now exactly two weeks away. In fact, I was feeling so stressed - I had to go grab a beer at 3pm to calm myself and focus with the days work. It actually really helped 😅.

### Day 2

Friday, 25 October 2019: ☁️ 14° - Thick cloud and a fresh breeze
 
Julio did an incredible job getting the first version of the formula autocomplete feature working - check the video below!

Need to start work on marketing today, and find a way to try and get more people talking to me. PLEASE SOMEBODY TALK TO ME! 😂

  - [x] Talk to a potential user (e.g. start-up founder) - Megamaker Slack Group?
  - [x] Sent blog e-mail out
  - [ ] Create new card inputs apprach (make editing cards much nicer!) 
  - [ ] Start one new marketing channel

	<summary><h4>Talk with Potential User</h4></summary>

	Founder - SaaS - Developer Tools / Productivity

	Has built his own internal dashboard to see the metrics that really matter to him. Doesn't use other tools, because existing dashboards don't show him what he needs - or would take too long to configure! His current (internally built dashboard), pulls everything from his DB. He's not sure if he would give access to the DB or not. There's basically only 3 options getting DB data - push (like Mixpanel `track`), pull from an exposed API that gets data from the DB or direct DB access. Seems like the best option might be some kind of push - and then we can create a library for each language.

	Metrics that matter are Signups, Installs, Active Customers. He also tracks engagement on a per user level - so he sees if users have done key activity like - how far are they through their trial, how many participants, how many reports they've generated.

	Recommended that I start a Typeform to ask people what integrations they want, sounds like a good idea. Unsure whether to send it to the entire list on Snapboard though, because I don't want to send too many e-mails and I want to update them once we have more apps in play - oh wait - that's catch 22 😂. I probably need to e-mail them next week anyway, to allow people time to engage before the interview so I'll attach it to that.

	They use the following apps:

	* Beamer
	* Helpscout
	* Sentry
	* Stripe
	* Mixpanel - no longer uses as much
	* Mailerlite
	* Postmark
	* AWS / EC2 and RDS
	* Datadog
	* Logrocket
