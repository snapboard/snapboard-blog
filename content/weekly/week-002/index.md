Last week went well, but the major focus has to be on creating more cards, more quickly. In addition, these remain my top priorities:

 1. Cards - adding new integrations and cards
 2. Marketing - getting people to visit to [snapboard.io](https://snapboard.io)
 3. Optimize - small changes which increase conversion - getting more people to signup and create cards
 4. Talk - keep talking to users (which should help shape the above items)


## Plan

Based on the above - I want to acheive the following this week:

  - [ ] Talk to 3 more users
  - [ ] Improve "edit card" page
  - [ ] Create 40 new cards / integrations
  - [ ] Start testing 3 [“Traction”](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/0241242533) growth channels
  - [ ] Setup public Snapboard metrics page - so I can better track changes
