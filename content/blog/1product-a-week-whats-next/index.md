When I first launched 1 Product a Week, some people challenged the entire premise. 

```
“How are you going to build anything of value if you change every week?"
```

Well, I never said I would do it forever. In fact, I specifically said I would do it [until something worked](/why-one-product-a-week). It just turns out if you actually build and launch stuff, it doesn’t take too long to find something that works! Snapboard was only my “Week 2” attempt at 1 Product a Week.

So, I’ve decided to change things up a bit - I'm going to be archiving 1 Product a Week for now, and continuing the updates on a new blog over at Snapboard. The new blog will be very similar, but this time I'll be sharing how I take Snapboard from a successful launch into a fully fledged product.

I’ll be taking the best parts from 1 Product a Week - articles about my experience, more videos and daily updates of my struggle / progress.

If you’d like to continue this journey with me, please [follow along on the Snapboard blog](https://snapboard.io/blog).
