We’re all incredibly busy and it’s very easy to lose track of important things. That’s made even harder by the fact we’re now using so many different apps - and each one has a separate dashboard you need to login to!

More than once I’ve been stung by a bigger than expected AWS bill (totally forgot to cancel that instance), not noticed a sudden drop in users (oh darn that page is broken), or not reacted to a social mention (missed opportunity). I just need a quick snapshot of everything that’s important today - without logging into a million different app dashboards!

The problem is, everyone has a very different view on what’s important to them - marketing, sales and finance all want to see something different. As a founder (and project manager at Virgin Media) I could never find the metrics I needed, and existing dashboards simply don’t take customisation seriously.

So I decided to create Snapboard - a simple customizable dashboard, with all the key things you need to know each day.
